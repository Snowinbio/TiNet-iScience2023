Implementation code of TiNet: Human-understandable thyroid ultrasound imaging AI report system â€” A bridge between AI and clinicians

## Usage
1. For the input image, first use the ForOptFPN method to segment, you can use segmentation/scripts/train_ForOptFPN.sh for training, and use segmentation/scripts/eval_ForOptFPN.sh for testing
2. The model folder contains methods for extracting five features of images.

## Input Data
The input is an ultrasound image of the thyroid containing a nodule. The input is an ultrasound image of the thyroid gland containing a nodule.

## Metrics
Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity and AUC. For the segmentation model, IOU is also used for evaluation.
